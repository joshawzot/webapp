write me a linux command that can remove all the file names that started with "MaxZhang" under the current directory (for all file types), for example "'MaxZhang_100cyc_reprogram_125C22.sql" will be deleted
find . -type f -name 'MaxZhang*' -exec rm {} +

#I have 2 branches, one is main the other is "branch1", I want to merge the branch1 into mian (meaning that the main will be updated to the "branch1", but if there is conflict (main has its own commit after the branching of branch1, what would I do. 1. first give me the strategy when there is no conflict, and 2. give me the strategy when there is conflict

   git checkout main
      git fetch
         git merge branch1
            git push origin main
